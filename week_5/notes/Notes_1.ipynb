    "\n",
    "- To make the web service predict the churn value for each customer we must modify the code in session 3 with the code we had in previous chapters. Below we can see how the code works in order to predict the churn value.\n",
    "- In order to predict we need to first load the previous saved model and use a prediction function in a special route.\n",
    "  - To load the previous saved model we use the code below:\n",
    "  - ```\n",
    "    import pickle\n",
    "    \n",
    "    with open('churn-model.bin', 'rb') as f_in:\n",
    "      dv, model = pickle.load(f_in)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - As we had earlier to predict a value for a customer we need a function like below:\n",
    "  - ```\n",
    "    def predict_single(customer, dv, model):\n",
    "      X = dv.transform([customer])  ## apply the one-hot encoding feature to the customer data \n",
    "      y_pred = model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]\n",
    "      return y_pred[0]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   - Then at last we make the final function used for creating the web service.\n",
    "   - ```\n",
    "     @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])  ## in order to send the customer information we need to post its data.\n",
    "     def predict():\n",
    "     customer = request.get_json()  ## web services work best with json frame, So after the user post its data in json format we need to access the body of json.\n",
    "\n",
    "     prediction = predict_single(customer, dv, model)\n",
    "     churn = prediction >= 0.5\n",
    "     \n",
    "     result = {\n",
    "         'churn_probability': float(prediction), ## we need to conver numpy data into python data in flask framework\n",
    "         'churn': bool(churn),  ## same as the line above, converting the data using bool method\n",
    "     }\n",
    "\n",
    "     return jsonify(result)  ## send back the data in json format to the user\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - At last run your code. To see the result can't use a simple request in web browser. We can run the code below to post a new user data and see the response\n",

    " - Until here we saw how we made a simple web server that predicts the churn value for every user. When you run your app you will see a warning that it is not a WGSI server and not suitable for production environmnets. To fix this issue and run this as a production server there are plenty of ways available. \n",
    "   - One way to create a WSGI server is to use gunicorn. To install it use the command ```pip install gunicorn```, And to run the WGSI server you can simply run it with the   command ```gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:9696 churn:app```. Note that in __churn:app__ the name churn is the name we set for our the file containing the code ```app = Flask('churn')```(for example: churn.py), You may need to change it to whatever you named your Flask app file.  \n",
    "   -  Windows users may not be able to use gunicorn library because windows system do not support some dependecies of the library. So to be able to run this on a windows   machine, there is an alternative library waitress and to install it just use the command ```pip install waitress```. \n",
    "   -  to run the waitress wgsi server use the command ```waitress-serve --listen=0.0.0.0:9696 churn:app```.\n",
    "   -  To test it just you can run the code above and the results is the same.\n",
    " - So until here you were able to make a production server that predict the churn value for new customers\n"
