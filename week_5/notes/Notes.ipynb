    "# Save and Load a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Save and load the model can be easily achieved using the Python's inbuilt module called Pickle\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Pickle?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pickle is a Standard way of serializing objects in Python. It can be a Machine Learning Algorithm or any other Object.\n",
    "* You can serialize and save the model or Object using Pickle . It is saved in a serialized format as a file.\n",
    "* When you need to re-use or re-load the same Model or Object , you can reload and de-serialize the file using Pickle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Save the model and dictvector into model.bin file using pickle\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "    import pickle\n",
    "    with open('model.bin', 'wb') as f_out:\n",
    "       pickle.dump((dcit_vectorizer, model), f_out)\n",
    "    f_out.close() ## After opening any file it's nessecery to close it\n",
    "`\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Load the dictvector and model from pickled file\n",
    " \n",
    "`\n",
    "    with open('mode.bin', 'rb') as f_in:  ## Note that never open a binary file you do not trust!\n",
    "        dict_vectorizer, model = pickle.load(f_in)\n",
    "    f_in.close()\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "By this approach, we don't need to run and get the model for each prediction(DRY)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run the Prediction as Webservice\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is actually a web service\n",
    "  - A web service is a method used to communicate between electronic devices.\n",
    "  - Webserice offers users to do CRUD opeartions\n",
    "  - There are some methods in web services we can use it to satisfy our problems. Here below we would list some.\n",
    "    - **POST:**(CREATE) POST is the second common method used in web services. For example in a sign up process, when we are submiting our name, username, passwords, etc we are posting our data to a server that is using the web service. (Note that there is no specification where the data goes)\n",
    "    - **GET:**(READ)  GET is a method used to retrieve files, For example whene we are searching for a cat image in google we are actually requesting cat images with GET method.\n",
    "    -  **PUT:**(UPDATE) PUT is same as POST but we are specifying where the data is going to.\n",
    "    -  **DELETE:**(DELETE) DELETE is a method that is used to request to delete some data from the server.\n",
    "    These are all the CRUD operations which performs in the form HTTP methods\n",
    "- To create a simple web service, there are plenty libraries available in every language. Here we would like to introduce Flask library in python.\n",
    "  - If you haven't install the library just try installing it with the ```pip install flask```\n",
    "  - To create a simple web service just run the code below:\n",
    "  - ```\n",
    "    from flask import Flask\n",
    "    app = Flask('churn-app') # give an identity to your web service\n",
    "    @app.route('/ping',methods=[GET])\n",
    "    def ping():\n",
    "        return 'PONG'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if __name__=='__main__':\n",
    "       app.run('debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5252) # run the code in local machine with the debugging mode true and port 9696\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   - With the code above we made a simple web server and created a route named ping that would send pong string.\n",
    "   - to test it just open your browser and search ```localhost:5252/ping```, You'll see that the 'PONG' string is received. Congrats You've made a simple web server ðŸ¥³.\n",
    "- To use our web server to predict new values we must modify it. See how in the next session. "
