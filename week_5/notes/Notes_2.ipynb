    "-   Managing a `requirements.txt` file [can be\n",
    "    problematic](https://kennethreitz.org/essays/2016/02/25/a-better-pip-workflow),\n",

    "Installation\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "If you\\'re using Debian Buster+:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ sudo apt install pipenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if you\\'re using Fedora:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ sudo dnf install pipenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if you\\'re using FreeBSD:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # pkg install py36-pipenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if you\\'re using Windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # pip install --user pipenv\n",
    "\n",
    "When none of the above is an option, it is recommended to use [Pipx](https://pypi.org/p/pipx):\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pipx install pipenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, refer to the [documentation](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/#install-pipenv-today) for instructions.\n",

    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Enables truly *deterministic builds*, while easily specifying *only\n",
    "    what you want*.\n",
    "-   Generates and checks file hashes for locked dependencies.\n",
    "-   Automatically install required Pythons, if `pyenv` is available.\n",
    "-   Automatically finds your project home, recursively, by looking for a\n",
    "    `Pipfile`.\n",
    "-   Automatically generates a `Pipfile`, if one doesn\\'t exist.\n",
    "-   Automatically creates a virtualenv in a standard location.\n",
    "-   Automatically adds/removes packages to a `Pipfile` when they are\n",
    "    un/installed.\n",
    "-   Automatically loads `.env` files, if they exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main commands are `install`, `uninstall`, and `lock`, which\n",
    "generates a `Pipfile.lock`. These are intended to replace\n",
    "`$ pip install` usage, as well as manual virtualenv management (to\n",
    "activate a virtualenv, run `$ pipenv shell`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A virtualenv will automatically be created, when one doesn\\'t exist.\n",
    "-   When no parameters are passed to `install`, all packages\n",
    "    `[packages]` specified will be installed.\n",
    "-   To initialize a Python 3 virtual environment, run\n",
    "    `$ pipenv --three`.\n",
    "-   To initialize a Python 2 virtual environment, run `$ pipenv --two`.\n",
    "-   Otherwise, whatever virtualenv defaults to will be the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `shell` will spawn a shell with the virtualenv activated.\n",
    "-   `run` will run a given command from the virtualenv, with any\n",
    "    arguments forwarded (e.g. `$ pipenv run python`).\n",
    "-   `check` asserts that PEP 508 requirements are being met by the\n",
    "    current environment.\n",
    "-   `graph` will print a pretty graph of all your installed\n",
    "    dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shell Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with fish, put this in your\n",
    "`~/.config/fish/completions/pipenv.fish`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    eval (pipenv --completion)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, with bash, put this in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    eval \"$(pipenv --completion)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Magic shell completions are now enabled! There is also a [fish\n",
    "plugin](https://github.com/fisherman/pipenv), which will automatically\n",
    "activate your subshells for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fish is the best shell. You should use it.\n",

In specific cases you also have access to other schemes: `svn` may be combined with `svn` as a scheme, and `bzr` can be combined with `sftp` and `lp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is **strongly recommended** that you install any version-controlled dependencies in editable mode, using `pipenv install -e`, in order to ensure that dependency resolution can be performed with an up to date copy of the repository each time it is performed, and that it includes all known dependencies.\n",
